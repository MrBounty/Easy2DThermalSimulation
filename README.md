# Easy2DThermalSimulation
This is the first project I have done. It allows to thermally simulate a ligne in 1D, a rectangle in 2D and a cuboid in 3D by choosing the properties of the materials and others. It's full of mistakes, don't do much but I spent time there, learned a lot of programming basics while doing it and it's my first baby so I'm proud of it.
